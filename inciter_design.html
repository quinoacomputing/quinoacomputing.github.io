<p>This page discusses the high-level software design and some implementation aspects of <a href="inciter_main.html" class="m-dox">Inciter</a>. The discussion roughly follows as execution happens in time, from program start to finish. On any of the Charm++ concepts below, consult the <a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/manual.html">Charm++ manual</a>.</p><section id="inciter_startup"><h2><a href="#inciter_startup">1. Startup and migration of read-only global-scope data</a></h2><section id="inciter_startup_itself"><h3><a href="#inciter_startup_itself">Startup</a></h3><p>As all other executables in Quinoa, Inciter uses the Charm++ runtime system. Runtime execution starts in the Charm++ <code>mainmodule</code> constructor, defined in Main/Inciter.C as <code><a href="class_main.html" class="m-dox">Main</a></code>. Starting down the constructor&#x27;s initializer list, the command line is parsed, followed by creating a driver, <a href="classinciter_1_1_inciter_driver.html" class="m-dox">InciterDriver</a>, which parses the input file.</p></section><section id="inciter_startup_parsing"><h3><a href="#inciter_startup_parsing">Command line and input file parsing, global-scope data</a></h3><p>After the main chare constructor has finished, the runtime system initializes global scope data and migrates it to all other processing elements (PEs), which from that point is considered read-only.</p><p>This global-scope data are defined at the beginning of Main/Inciter.C in the same order as they appear in the companion Charm++ interface file <a href="inciter_8ci.html" class="m-dox">Main/<wbr />inciter.ci</a>. This is the order in which these data are initialized and migrated. Global scope data is limited to such read-only data. It stores data initialized during parsing the command line and the input (control) file. The command line is parsed by <a href="classinciter_1_1_cmd_line_parser.html" class="m-dox">CmdLineParser</a>&#x27;s constructor, called during the main chare&#x27;s constructor, while the input file is parsed by <a href="classinciter_1_1_input_deck_parser.html" class="m-dox">InputDeckParser</a>&#x27;s constructor, called during <a href="classinciter_1_1_inciter_driver.html" class="m-dox">InciterDriver</a>&#x27;s constructor.</p><p>Global_scope data is always prefixed by <code>g_</code>. Inciter&#x27;s global-scope data contains two input decks: the defaults (g_inputdeck_defaults) and g_inputdeck which contains all data parsed during command line and input file parsing.</p><aside class="m-note m-danger"><h4>Warning</h4><p>Note that this global-scope data is <em>assumed</em> read-only after migration but the compiler has no way of enforcing this, thus modifying it after migration is possible but will not generate an error either at compile or runtime. For more details on global scope data in Charm++, see Section <em>Read-only Data</em> in the Charm++ manual.</p></aside></section><section id="inciter_startup_polymorphism"><h3><a href="#inciter_startup_polymorphism">Global scope data for runtime polymorphism</a></h3><p>Two global scope vectors in inciter are <code>g_cgpde</code> and <code>g_dgpde</code>. These two vectors hold base classes for partial differential equations (PDE) that can be specialized to different types of derived PDEs that use continuous Galerkin finite element (FE) discretizations (<a href="classinciter_1_1_c_g_p_d_e.html" class="m-dox">CGPDE</a>) and discontinuous Galerkin FE discretizations (<a href="classinciter_1_1_d_g_p_d_e.html" class="m-dox">DGPDE</a>). These two vectors are global scope because they hold pointers to derived classes that enable runtime polymorphism. Runtime polymorphism enables code reuse and helps client code stay uniform and modular. Such polymorphic use of pointers (<code>std::unique_ptr</code>) are one of the rare uses of pointers throughout the code.</p><aside class="m-note m-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>While Charm++ allows migratable chares holding pointers and even supports runtime polymorphism among chare arrays, we strongly discourage the use of pointers and reference semantics, because it complicates writing safe code for such migratable objects. For more details on reference and value semantics in C++, see <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/value-vs-ref-semantics">https:/<wbr />/<wbr />isocpp.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />faq/<wbr />value-vs-ref-semantics</a>. For more details on runtime polymorphism without client-side inheritance, the style in which the &quot;base&quot; classes <a href="classinciter_1_1_c_g_p_d_e.html" class="m-dox">CGPDE</a> and <a href="classinciter_1_1_d_g_p_d_e.html" class="m-dox">DGPDE</a> are written, that leads to cleaner and safer client code, see Sean Parent&#x27;s talk on <a href="http://sean-parent.stlab.cc/papers-and-presentations/#value-semantics-and-concept-based-polymorphism">concept-based polymorphism</a>. For more details on concept-based runtime polymorphism with migratable Charm++ chare arrays using value semantics, see Inciter/Scheme.h and the talk, titled <em>Concept-based runtime polymorphism with Charm++ chare arrays using value semantics</em>, given at the <a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/workshops/charmWorkshop2018/program.php">16th Annual Workshop on Charm++ and its Applications</a>.</p></aside></section><section id="inciter_startup_transporter"><h3><a href="#inciter_startup_transporter">Create inciter&#x27;s driver, single Charm++ chare Transporter</a></h3><p>Up to this point execution is serial, since there is only a single main Charm++ chare. <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_inciter_driver.html" class="m-dox">InciterDriver</a></code>&#x27;s constructor then fires up a single Charm++ chare instance of <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code>, called from <a href="class_main.html#aa4e0afaa96eda09358acfacfb672fe41" class="m-dox">Main::<wbr />execute()</a> after the runtime system has finished migrating all global-scope data. Note that <a href="classinciter_1_1_inciter_driver.html" class="m-dox">InciterDriver</a> is <em>not</em> a Charm++ chare, only an ordinary C++ class. <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code>, defined in Inciter/Transporter.C, is the main driver class of Inciter that is a Charm++ chare from which all execution happens, e.g., via broadcasts, and to which all execution ends up in, leading to <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html#a210a63a6cb2656c5591e3fc19e8fc2c9" class="m-dox">Transporter::<wbr />finish()</a></code>, which eventually calls back to <code><a href="class_main.html#a79fa7f2b2377b41626163cd6f3e2073d" class="m-dox">Main::<wbr />finalize()</a></code>, calling <code>CkExit()</code>, signaling the runtime system to exit.</p></section></section><section id="inciter_classes"><h2><a href="#inciter_classes">2. Important classes</a></h2><p>Here are the important classes that interoperate within inciter:</p><ul><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code> (single chare, driver)</li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_partitioner.html" class="m-dox">Partitioner</a></code> (chare <em>nodegroup</em>, mesh partitioner)</li><li><code><a href="classtk_1_1_mesh_writer.html" class="m-dox">tk::<wbr />MeshWriter</a></code> (chare <em>group</em>, mesh writer, performing file output in parallel)</li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_refiner.html" class="m-dox">Refiner</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, mesh refiner)</li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_sorter.html" class="m-dox">Sorter</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, performs mesh reordering)</li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_discretization.html" class="m-dox">Discretization</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, generic PDE solver base class)<ul><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_diag_c_g.html" class="m-dox">DiagCG</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, PDE solver child class, specialized to a continuous Galerkin finite element discretization scheme with a lumped-mass left-hand side and flux-corrected transport combined with Lax-Wendroff-like explicit time stepping scheme that is second order accurate in space and time),</li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_d_g.html" class="m-dox">DG</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, PDE solver child class, specialized to a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization scheme with a diagonal left-hand side with explicit Runge-Kutta time stepping),</li><li>... (more hydro schemes to be added in the future)</li></ul></li><li><code><a href="classinciter_1_1_dist_f_c_t.html" class="m-dox">DistFCT</a></code> (chare <em>array</em>, performs distributed-memory flux-corrected transport, if used by a specific discretization scheme, e.g., <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_diag_c_g.html" class="m-dox">DiagCG</a></code>)</li></ul><p><em>Chare</em> above means a single Charm++ chare. There is a single instance of this class. By design, <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code> is a single chare and is used as a driver that creates objects, used as a target of global parallel reductions, and thus global synchronization points. <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code> also does most of the printouts to screen, collects statistics, and is the end-point of execution in <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html#a210a63a6cb2656c5591e3fc19e8fc2c9" class="m-dox">Transporter::<wbr />finish()</a></code>.</p><p><em>Group</em> above means a Charm++ chare group. A group is a processor-aware chare collection, which means that there is guaranteed to be a single instance of a group per PE which does <em>not</em> migrate. <code>MeshWriter</code> is a group because it calls the MPI-only library, ExodusII, for outputing mesh and mesh-based solution field data to files. Note that while <code>MeshWriter</code> is a group, the way we use it makes it similar to a nodegroup but with group semantics: we call its Charm++ entry method <code>MeshWriter::write()</code> from multiple array elements (from <a href="classinciter_1_1_discretization.html" class="m-dox">Discretization</a>) targeting ony the first PE of each logical node. This yields &quot;serializing&quot; every call per node, required for the underlying non-thread-safe NetCDF/HDF5 library calls, made by ExodusII. This way writing large solution data works in both non-SMP and SMP mode correctly and efficiently, since parallel output load is configurable separately from the number of work-units for computation.</p><p><em>Nodegroup</em> above means a Charm++ chare nodegroup. A nodegroup is a processor-aware chare collection, which means that there is guaranteed to be a single instance of a nodegroup per logical (e.g., compute) node which does <em>not</em> migrate. <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_partitioner.html" class="m-dox">Partitioner</a></code> is a nodegroup because it calls MPI-only libraries.</p><aside class="m-note m-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>Charm++ <code>nodegroup</code>s, are similar to groups in that they are processor-aware but instead of one per PE, nodegroups are guaranteed to be one per logical (compute) node, where a <em>compute node</em> is understood to be a logical node which may or may not be equivalent to a physical compute node (i.e., a shared-memory node), depending on how a given execution environment is configured in Charm++&#x27;s symmetric multi-processing mode (SMP) mode. (For example, a run in SMP mode can be configured with a logical node corresponding to a shared-memory compute node or to a socket within a compute node). Similar to groups, nodegroups do not migrate but there are significant differences in their parallel computing semantics in how the runtime system invokes their member functions compared to groups. In particular, while member functions of chare arrays and groups execute exclusively in a single instance, node groups allow multiple <em>non-exclusive</em> member functions to execute concurrently in a single nodegroup instance. Note that there is no difference between groups and nodegroups if Charm++ is built in non-SMP mode, which is currently the default. For more details see the Charm++ manual.</p></aside><p><em>Array</em> above means a Charm++ chare array, whose elements can migrate (if enabled) and thus they actively participate in automatic load balancing. With nonzero overdecomposition, there may be more array elements (workers) than the number of available PEs. Arrays do the bulk of the heavy lifting in a calculation, i.e., computing right-hand sides for PDE operators, and hold the bulk of unknown/solution arrays. The degree of overdecomposition can be specified by the <code>-u</code> command line argument. This argument accepts a real value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 means no overdecomposition, which corresponds to partitioning the mesh into a number of pieces equalling the number of PEs available. (<code>-u 0.0</code> yields an execution style that is most similar to how MPI codes are traditionally used, which is the default.) Nonzero overdecomposition yields larger number of mesh partitions than the available PEs. The extreme of <code>1.0</code> represents the largest degree of overdecomposition, which also results in the smallest work units. For a discussion on the effects of overdecomposition, see the page on <a href="inciter_performance.html" class="m-dox">Inciter performance</a>.</p><p><em>Bound arrays</em>: <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_discretization.html" class="m-dox">Discretization</a></code> and its specialized children, <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_diag_c_g.html" class="m-dox">DiagCG</a></code>, <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_d_g.html" class="m-dox">DG</a></code>, etc., <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_refiner.html" class="m-dox">Refiner</a></code>, and, if used/created, <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_dist_f_c_t.html" class="m-dox">DistFCT</a></code> are <em>bound</em> arrays. This means that the runtime system migrates its corresponding array elements together. Bound arrays facilitate modularization among workers that migrate. Since array elements that are bound always appear together on a given PE, even after migration, they can also be thought of as part of the same class, because they can access data from each other (but still respecting the C++ rules of <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, etc). However, dividing functionality into classes, as always, helps readibility and makes reasoning about code easier.</p></section><section id="inciter_setup"><h2><a href="#inciter_setup">3. Setup</a></h2><section id="inciter_transporter_ctor"><h3><a href="#inciter_transporter_ctor">Transporter constructor</a></h3><p>Inciter&#x27;s setup starts with <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code>&#x27;s constructor. After some printouts on configuration, some of the important classes are created, introduced above. In some cases, we simply call Charm++&#x27;s <code>ckNew()</code> without arguments. This means an empty Charm++ chare array is created, we get hold of its proxy, but no constructors are run yet. An example for this is <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_sorter.html" class="m-dox">Sorter</a></code>. We do empty array creation for two main reasons: (1) we don&#x27;t yet have all data that is needed to create the given class (more preparation is required but we need its proxy already), and/or (2) we need to pass specific data to each array (or group) element&#x27;s constructor, which can only be done via dynamic insertion.

This is because the &quot;child&quot; is designed to be able to directly access data from its base, as in usual runtime polymorphism. Such direct access of (large) data allows not having to create copies and allows reducing communication costs, while still allos modularizing code operating on the same data. For more details on <a href="classinciter_1_1_scheme.html" class="m-dox">Scheme</a>, SchemeBase, <a href="classinciter_1_1_discretization.html" class="m-dox">Discretization</a>, and its children, see Inciter/Scheme.h.</p></aside><p>In many cases, we pass a number of callbacks to chare arrays and groups when their Charm++ proxy is created with <code>ckNew()</code>. These callbacks are of type <code>CkCallback</code>. This is one technique that we use as a kind of type erasure so that these classes can interoperate with each other as well as with their host, <a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a>. This helps resolving cyclic include dependencies. These callbacks mostly denote reduction targets to <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code>, that are necessary synchronization points during setup. A <code>CkCallback</code> is similar to std::function or a C-style function pointer, but can also store a callback to a Charm++ chare object that happens to reside across the network, i.e., an entry method call via a proxy.</p></section><section id="inciter_partitioner_ctor"><h3><a href="#inciter_partitioner_ctor">Partitioner constructor</a></h3><p>While from <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_transporter.html" class="m-dox">Transporter</a></code>&#x27;s constructor we create a number of Charm++ chare arrays, most of them are empty to start with. An exception is <code><a href="classinciter_1_1_partitioner.html" class="m-dox">Partitioner</a></code>, whose constructor starts by reading a different chunk of the mesh in blocks as they appear in the file.

Note that only the portion of all this data is read in on a nodegroup that belongs to a given chunk of the mesh.
