Due to <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle">unprecedented hardware complexity</a> and features such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy">deep memory hierarchies</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">dynamic frequency scaling</a>, we must assume <em>a priori</em> unknown and inhomogeneous computational load and performance among parts of the system that can also dynamically change in time. As large problems are partitioned into smaller chunks, information along partition boundaries, that exist on multiple processing elements, must be made consistent, which requires communication. To efficiently use resources our programming paradigm must allow <em>asynchronous</em> parallel execution and communication. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication">asynchronous communication</a> data is not transmitted at regular intervals and the transmitter and receiver do not have to be synchronized. Compared to synchronized (or blocking) communication, such asynchronous communication enables overlapping computation, communication, input, and output. However, asynchronous programming constitutes a major paradigm shift compared to the more traditional bulk-synchronous approach, widely applied for large-scale scientific computing, e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing_in_computer_clusters">message passing</a>. We believe that the most economic utilization of future computer hardware can only be achieved with a paradigm shift from bulk-synchronous to fully asynchronous programming. For most computational codes this deeply affects the programming style as well as the optimal data layout and algorithm structure which therefore would require a complete rewrite.</p><p>Quinoa was started from scratch, instead of modifying an existing code, to allow full freedom in exercising the asynchronous paradigm. The code is built on the <a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu">Charm++</a> runtime system and family of libraries. Instead of message passing, Charm++ is founded on the migratable-objects programming model and supported by an adaptive runtime system. In Charm++ data and work-units interact via asynchronous function calls enabling fully asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming can be used to specify task-parallelism as well as data parallelism in a single application using a single abstraction. The interacting objects may reside on the same or on a networked compute node and may migrate from one to another during computation. Object migration is transparent to the application and carried out by the runtime system based on real-time load and hardware measurement, but if needed can be influenced by the application. Charm++ is mature, it has been actively developed since 1989, and is used by <a href="http://charmplusplus.org/applications/">several large production codes</a>. Read a one-page summary on the strengths of Charm++ at <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/why">http:/<wbr />/<wbr />charm.cs.uiuc.edu/<wbr />why</a>.</p><div class="m-col-t-4 m-col-m-2 m-right-t"><img class="m-image" src="Boton-correcto.svg" alt="Image" /></div></section><section id="correct"><h2><a href="#correct">Verified and proven to be correct</a></h2><p>Nothing is more important than code that works as advertised with no surprises. We strive for writing testable code as well as writing tests that cover the code to the maximum degree possible. Code coverage, the percentage of lines of code tested compared to all the code, is quantified using two independent tools: <a href="https://codecov.io">codecov.io</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">gcov</a>. Untested code is assumed to be incorrect until proven otherwise. Only with extensive <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">positive and negative</a> testing can developers and users be assured of correctness.</p><p>In Quinoa code correctness is verified and quantified using multiple levels of testing:</p><ul><li>Our unit test suite, <a href="unittest_main.html" class="m-dox">UnitTest</a>, capable of testing serial, synchronous (e.g., MPI) parallel, and asynchronous parallel (e.g., Charm++) functions with <a href="coverage.html" class="m-dox">code coverage analysis</a> is used to test the smallest units of code.</li><li>Our regression test suite with <a href="coverage.html" class="m-dox">code coverage analysis</a> is used to test features larger than the smallest units, such as multiple algorithms coupled to solve a differential equation.</li><li>A <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl">planned</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzz test</a> suite will help prepare against invalid, unexpected, or random inputs.</li></ul><div class="m-col-t-4 m-col-m-2 m-right-t"><img class="m-image" src="Triangle.svg" alt="Image" /></div></section><section id="optimized"><h2><a href="#optimized">Optimized for performance, power, and reliability</a></h2><p>Power consumption is a primary concern in the exascale era. Application performance must be measured within power constraints on increasingly complex and thus likely less reliable hardware. A computation must optimize and thus dynamically adapt to maximize performance constrained by power limits while being resilient against hardware failures. This requires revolutionary methods with a stronger-than-before integration among hardware features, system software, and the application.</p><p>Quinoa relies on the <a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu">Charm++</a> runtime system. A central idea of Charm++ is to enable and facilitate <em>overdecomposition</em>: computation (data and work-units) is decomposed into a large number of logical units, usually more than the available processors. Overdecomposition enables the runtime system to dynamically adapt the computational load monitoring load-imbalance due to software (e.g., particle clustering, adaptive refinement) as well as hardware (e.g., dynamic processor frequency scaling). The runtime system also migrates data and work-units if it notices (via sensors, cache monitors, etc.) that a compute node is about to fail. If a node fails without a warning, the application can be restarted from a previously saved checkpoint. Since work decomposition and parallel programming are done without direct reference to physical processors, the application can be restarted using a number of processors different than that of the checkpoint was saved with. Resiliency is provided by the runtime system transparent to the application and can save millions of cycles since jobs have to be restarted less frequently due to hardware failure.

Simultaneously satisfying all the different requirements enumerated here inevitably increases software complexity. Attempting to tackle every aspect by the application programmer, as is frequently done in a research context and sometimes also in production, does not scale as more features are added, i.e., not economical thus unsustainable. The combination of increasing hardware and software complexity leads to an unprecedented degree of specialization among the software components as well as their developers. <em>Picking the right tool for the right job</em>, components of complex software must be outsourced to subject-matter experts.</p><p>Quinoa&#x27;s goal is to provide simulation software for scientific and engineering purposes. This involves numerically solving the differential and integral equations of mathematical physics. We cannot claim to be experts in all ingredients required, therefore highly specialized components, e.g., advanced computer science, such as load decomposition, dynamic load balancing, object migration, low level hardware-specific networking, parallel input and output, random number generation, hashing, etc., are outsourced to those who make a career out them. We subscribe to the <a href="https://youtu.be/jNNz9poyKJs">proudly found elsewhere</a> paradigm, instead of the <em>not invented here</em> stance. Accordingly, Quinoa uses a number of <a href="licenses.html" class="m-dox">third-party libraries</a>.</p><div class="m-col-t-4 m-col-m-2 m-right-t"><img class="m-image" src="celticknot1.svg" alt="Image" /></div></section><section id="language"><h2><a href="#language">Use a programming language that can cope with complexity</a></h2><p>The ultimate measure of the value of a computer language is how it balances runtime performance and code complexity.

However, this does not necessarily require a graphical user interface. Also, expert developers should be able to get started quickly, extend the code in a productive manner, and tailor functionality to their or their customer&#x27;s needs.</p><p>User input in Quinoa is restricted to command-line arguments and simple-to-read text files. The input grammar is versatile and extensible. Parsing (but not the grammar) is outsourced to a library written by experts in that field. Error messages are friendly and often suggest a solution. Documentation of command-line and input file keywords is directly accessible at the user&#x27;s fingertips, obtained via command-line arguments (<code>-h</code>, <code>-H</code>). New keywords, reflecting new features, are made impossible to add without proper in-code documentation.
